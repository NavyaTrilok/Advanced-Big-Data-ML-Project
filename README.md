Analyzing weather data

Analyzing weather data using PySpark can provide valuable insights into weather patterns and trends, which can have practical applications in various industries. 
For instance, in the agriculture industry, knowing the weather patterns in a region can help farmers plan their crops and irrigation schedule accordingly. In the tourism industry, weather data can be used to optimize travel packages and recommend the best time to visit a particular destination. 
In the case of disaster response, accurate weather data and predictions can help authorities prepare and respond appropriately.
